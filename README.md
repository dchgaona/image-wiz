# Image Wizard 🧙🏾‍♀🪄

Image Wizard (image-wiz) is a simple API made with FastAPI that tampers and modifies images using Pillow.
This API is made as a [Roadmapsh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/image-processing-service) project, of intermediate difficulty, from the backend roadmap.
Name is inspired from ImageMagick.
